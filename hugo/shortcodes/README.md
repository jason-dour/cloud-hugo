# cloud-hugo/hugo/shortcodes

Hugo shortcodes that will assist with leveraging the `cloud-hugo` fundamentals.

## Current Shortcodes

* `graphviz.html`
  * Pass block content through Graphviz and return an HTML snippet containing the SVG generated by `dot`.
* `mermaid.html`
  * Pass block content through Mermaid and return an HTML snippet containing the SVG generated by `mmdc`.

## Caveat Emptor

These shortcodes do not work at present.  Because they are all predicated on an `exec()` capability that does not yet exist in Hugo.  You can look at [my fork of Hugo](/jason-dour/hugo) for this feature that is a work in progress.
