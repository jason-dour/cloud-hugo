# Directory Structure For Hugo
#
# This layout is intended to help support our design fundamentals.
# It separates everything into three categories:
#     1. Source Content - What authors work with.
#     2. Hugo Content - Themes, templates; what site coordinators work with.
#     3. Output - What is generated by Hugo as part of the automated publishing pipeline.
#
# First, let's set the output directory...
publishDir: out
# ...then put Hugo theme and templating into a hugo hierarchy...
archetypeDir: hugo/archetypes
assetDir: hugo/assets
layoutDir: hugo/layouts
themesDir: hugo/themes
resourceDir: hugo/resources
# ...and finally author-managed data in a src hierarchy.
contentDir: src/content
dataDir: src/data
staticDir: src/static
